# news-service-PHEIDI
A news service to analyse the sentiment and topic of news to see trends. A continuation of project: https://github.com/llange-TUM/unicredit_PHEIDI.
The Goal of this project is to have a platform that analyses sentiment of news to catch the change in the narative in news about the DAX 40 companies. The news are fetched using https://newscatcherapi.com/. Then the sentiment is analyzed with the help of open source LLM models from Hugging face.
